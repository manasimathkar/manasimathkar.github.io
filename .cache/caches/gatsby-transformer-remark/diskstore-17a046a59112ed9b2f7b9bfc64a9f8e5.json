After preprocessing, data passes through an embedding layer, then the LSTM layer, and finally a dense layer that classifies statements as humorous or not. Hosted as a web app, this tool provides an interactive interface for users to input sentences and receive humor assessments instantly. The LSTM model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.62%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing humor patterns, which could further aid in developing automated humor generation systems.</p>"}
