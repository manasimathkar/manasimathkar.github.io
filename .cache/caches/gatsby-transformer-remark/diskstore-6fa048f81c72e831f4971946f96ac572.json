After preprocessing, data passes through an embedding layer, then the LSTM layer, and finally a dense layer that classifies statements as humorous or not. Hosted as a web app, this tool provides an interactive interface for users to input sentences and receive humor assessments instantly. The LSTM model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.62%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing humor patterns, which could further aid in developing automated humor generation systems.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":643,"offset":643}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":643,"offset":643}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":644}}}}
