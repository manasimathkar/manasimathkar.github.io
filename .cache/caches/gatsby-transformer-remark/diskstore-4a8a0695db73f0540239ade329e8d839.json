After preprocessing, data passes through an embedding layer, then the LSTM layer, and finally a dense layer that classifies statements as humorous or not. Hosted as a web app, this tool provides an interactive interface for users to input sentences and receive humor assessments instantly. The LSTM model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.62%, This publication in the IEEE Xplore underscores the modelâ€™s potential to contribute to automated humor generation.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":621,"offset":621},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":621,"offset":621},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":622}}}}
