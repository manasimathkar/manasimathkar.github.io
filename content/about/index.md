From the bustling streets of Mumbai at Thadomal Shahani Engineering College to the innovative hubs at the University of Southern California, my educational journey in Computer Science has been nothing short of transformative. This path didn't just enhance my technical skills; it honed my ability to innovate and problem-solve at a global scale.
